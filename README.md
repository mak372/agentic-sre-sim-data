# Agentic SRE Simulation Data

This repository contains simulated observability data used by an agentic
incident response system for demo and development purposes.

## Contents

- Logs: Realistic service logs grouped by incident type
- Runbooks: Incident-specific SRE runbooks
- Deploy History: Simulated CI/CD deployment data
- Service Docs: Basic service architecture and dependencies

This data mimics production systems such as:
- Loki / ElasticSearch (logs)
- Prometheus (metrics correlation)
- GitHub Actions / ArgoCD (deployments)
- Internal SRE runbooks
